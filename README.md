# kibanchizu-converter

## Preface
"Kiban Chizu Jouho(基盤地図情報)" is one of the Japanese GIS dataset provided by The Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI). The dataset is needed to be converted to adequate file formats because it is encoded by comforming to ISO 19100 series. The converting tool is provided by GSI, but the tool is only for Windows users. Because of this reason, I make a simple tool for Linux users who need convert tool for "Kiban Chizu Jouho(基盤地図情報)". This tool is developed by Python 2.7 scripts, and the GUI interface is designed by PyQt5.
